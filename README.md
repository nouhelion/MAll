# MAll

The Shopping Center wants to collect information from future Customers and provide them with a healthy and clean environment in order to control the spread of the virus, but the Shopping Center is faced with two problems:
→ The huge volume of customers that the Shopping Center must manage manually as well as ensure the hygiene of the place.
→ Positive customers must go to the mall in order to know the information concerning the products of the mall as well as the shopping.
Our motivation for the project lies on ARRIBAT CENTER, before the covid-19 epidemic, the huge volume of customers in the center indicates the good merchant and running of the economy, now a huge volume of customers can result in several cases of virus which results in the closure of the center for months and finally the bankruptcy of the center, this is why we created the idea of the reservation of the shopping center to manage the enormous volume of customers.

In order to overcome the shortcomings, we propose to computerize the marketing of products and the reservation of places in the shopping center by creating a virtual shopping site on the Internet.
The application must offer a set of services to customers and visitors wishing to enter the Shopping Center such as product consultation and restaurant and shopping center reservations.
